# Media Aggregator

Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTOJsU3FSD8), I built an app that will scrape a given news website every 15 minutes and store the results in a MongoDB collection.

The client side is a small React app that allows the user to view the stored data.

## Sites That Are Tracked

- [BBC news]('https://www.bbc.co.uk/news')
- [The Daily Mail]('https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html')
- [The Guardian]('https://www.theguardian.com/uk')
- [The Express]('https://www.express.co.uk/')
